</div>

I was at my first day of orientation at Google all excited to join the Google+ team when I got a text from my dad: "have you seen this?" and he attached a link to a news article, "Google Shutting Down Google+". I had not. But it was a prescient message.

Frankly when I heard the news I was not all that distraught. I was at Google now and nothing could bring me down. I was joining a Google+ team that was now making international headlines. How about that. What a great orientation icebreaker.

In reality, there were some challenges about joining this sunset effort that I had yet to understand. Much of the work my team had planned was effectively cancelled. But I wanted to contribute, frankly to learn *how* to contribute, so I found some work from other teams and found this open source effort called [Google Ground](https://github.com/google/ground-platform) that I contributed to as a 20% project. I'd say that nothing I did in that first year was particularly game-changing, but I did walk away with the confidence that I *was* a Google engineer and I *could* contribute at this level. And it set me up to make contributions that were more game-changing later in my time there. Frankly, in those early days at Google, part of me assumed the hard work of getting in was over and these fantastic opportunities would start to appear in front of me. But in some sense, the hard work was just beginning, to learn how to identify these opportunities, to go get them, and to follow through on them.

There was also a psychological challenge to working on a turn-down effort like Google+. Some people didn't want it to go away, like the core Google+ fans who really loved using it. But there were others who felt different, for whom it could not go away fast enough. This side would make memes about it, Google+, the butt of the joke, the product that Google tried to force the internet to love, etc, etc. It was just so polarized that nobody seemed happy about the Google+ turndown project. And this weighed on the team.

It's worth noting that I think Google is applying some lessons learned in the Google+ saga in the present. For example, the marketing for Nano Banana Pro is comparatively super subtle. There's a little banner with small text on Gemini, but no mentions on GMail, YouTube, like there used to be with Google+. I think Google got the message that such a concerted marketing effort can feel overwhelming and have toned it down, even for a social product they are excited about like Nano Banana.

Like with Nano Banana, it was content creators who really loved Google+. Photographers, poets, potters, painters, anyone who could make their art shareable over the web. In Google+, you could follow anyone, no friend request needed, which meant that creator followings could grow quicker, broader and more diverse than on Facebook. And through this creators seemed to really find meaning and connection. I went to a community-run goodbye event and there were tears. To me at the time, I was just a software engineer trying to write the best code, and I wasn't thinking of software in terms of emotional attachment. But looking back this emotional attachment was core to the Google+ turndown.

Through working on Google+ I feel like I got a taste of what the "old Google" was like. This crazy Silicon Valley startup that worked out of a garage or something, this zany place for zany people. We weren't in a garage but we did have our director gathering the team around for impromptu all hands, board games after work, dogs running around the office halls. It still had this zany feel to it. Later on, I'd occasionally be in a discussion with engineers that had been at Google for a while, and they'd swap stories about what Google used to be like. And I'd offer up my year on Google+.

After the project concluded, Google was lenient on the team in terms of giving us time to find a new role. Not everyone I knew was so hasty to leave. But I was. I was ready to go. I was young and I was brazenly ambitious, and I felt that this first year was a detour to my impending success. But looking back, that first year was so important to my growth. To just get thrown in to this environment and have to figure it out. I learned a lot about software, sure, but I also learned about how to navigate a big organization, and how to advocate for myself to get the outcomes that I want. I also met some incredibly talented people and felt quite humbled by it all.

Such is the tale of the Google+ sunset.

</div>

I was at my first day of orientation at Google all excited to join the Google+ team when I got a text from my dad: "have you seen this?" and he attached a link to a news article, "Google Shutting Down Google+". I had not. But it was a prescient message. It turned out that my first day of orientation was the day they announced they were shutting Google+ down.

Frankly when I heard the news I was not all that distraught. I was at Google now and nothing could bring me down. I was joining a Google+ team that was making international headlines. How about that. What a great orientation icebreaker.

In reality, there were some challenges about joining this sunset effort that I had yet to understand. I think it's hard to ramp up at Google in general, and particularly when entering an environment experiencing a sudden change in direction. Much of the work my team had planned was effectively cancelled. So for that first year I went out to other teams to find work, and networked around until I found an open source project that needed contributors called [Google Ground](https://github.com/google/ground-platform), and I made some contributions to that as a 20% project. I guess when I joined Google I assumed someone would guide me to all these fantastic projects and coach me up on how to do them. But the reality was I had to find these projects and mentors on my own, and they were not always as they were listed on the org chart.

There was also a psychological challenge to working on a turn-down effort like Google+. Some people loved it and didn't want it to go away. Like my teammates who made career bets on it and the core Google+ fans who really loved using it. There were others who felt differently, who seemed to hate it and for them it could not go away fast enough. This side would make memes about it, calling it a joke, the product that Google tried to force the internet to love, etc, etc. It was just so polarized that nobody seemed happy about the Google+ turndown project. And I think this weighed on the team.

Who wanted Google+ to stick around the most? Content creators. Photographers, poets, potters, painters, anyone who could make their art shareable over the digital web. Google+ was designed to be an [asymmetric](https://www.seobythesea.com/2011/08/googles-asymmetric-social-network-and-plus-authoring-patent) network, which meant you could follow anyone without a friend request, which meant that creator followings could grow quicker, broader and more diverse than on Facebook. And through this creators seemed to really find meaning and connection. I went to a community-run goodbye event and there were tears. To me at the time, I was just a software engineer trying to write the best software, and I wasn't thinking of software in terms of emotional attachment. But looking back this emotional attachment was core element of the the Google+ turndown.

Through working on Google+ I feel like I got a taste of what the "old Google" was like. This crazy Silicon Valley startup that worked out of a garage or something, this zany place for zany people. We weren't in a garage but we had our director gathering the team around for impromptu all hands, board games after work, dogs running around the office halls. It still had this zany feel to it. Later on, sometimes I'd be in a discussion with engineers that had been at Google for a while, and they'd swap stories about what Google used to be like. And I'd offer up my year on Google+.

After the project concluded, Google was lenient on the team in terms of giving us time to find a new role. Not everyone I knew was so hasty to leave. But I was. I was ready to go. I was young and I was brazenly ambitious, and I felt that this first year was a detour to my impending success. But looking back, that first year was so important to my growth. To just get thrown in to this environment and have to figure it out. I learned a lot about software, sure, but I also learned about how to navigate a big organization, and how to position myself to get the outcomes that I want. I also met some incredibly talented people and felt quite humbled by it all.

Such is the tale of the Google+ sunset.

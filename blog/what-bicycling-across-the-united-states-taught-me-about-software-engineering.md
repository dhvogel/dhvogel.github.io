# What bicycling across the United States taught me about software engineering

*November 11, 2025*

The summer between my first and second year of grad school, I rode my bicycle solo across America, from Portland, Maine to Pacific City, Oregon. Having just turned 30, I felt that for a journey like this, it was either now or never. I learned a lot over the course of this trip, about myself and the world around me, and I feel that some of it is applicable to software engineering. This post shares some of this learning.

## The importance of making a little progress every day

This giant bike ride across the United States was just 74 days of a little bit at a time.

Many large and ambitious projects are like this. One day at a time of just getting a little bit better, a little bit closer to the goal. Maybe some days are large jumps, and some days are small. But every day, a little closer.

On my trip, I could see my progress on a map. This is not always the case in the world of software. In some cases, it is up to you to create the map. And the way that progress on the map is marked can be not so obvious either.

Some days I would pull up the map, maybe in Michigan, or in Montana and I'd say to myself, "Wow, I can't believe I biked all that." And I'd recognize how far I'd come. It turned out that aside from my parents and close friends, no one was really following the trip. I wasn't a celeb. And most people I passed on the road had no idea I had started several thousand miles to the east.

In my time in the corporate world, I found that when I did a good job, it was not always the case that somebody patted me on the back and told me so. There was not always the capacity for recognizing the small wins and progress. So it became important for me to recognize and celebrate my own wins, to provide that incentive to attain the bigger goals, and provide a window for reflection.

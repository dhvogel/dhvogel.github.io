# What I got out of business school

At the end of my first year of business school, I was considering dropping out. I struggled socially and I felt alone. I knew I didn't want to be a consultant or a banker, and it seemed that by and large pursuing those career paths were how people made friends. I saw a lot of things in my first year that clashed with my understanding of right and wrong, but I will spare you the details. I just felt like this whole business school thing, it wasn't for me. I stayed on the premises that I had already put so much into this experience, between the self-discovery in the application, to moving to New Haven and completing the first-year core curriculum (which was quite a challenge!), that I owed it to myself to finish what I started. I also believed that in a world where I didn't have to worry about anything, about money, or a career, I would probably end up in an environment like Yale, learning things from experts who had spent their whole lives studying something, and were now teaching it to me. So I stayed.

Reflecting back, what I really wanted was to explore the world. I had my dream job as a software engineer at Google, but I was sick of it, sick of all the process, burned out by the Covid lockdown, just needing a change. I saw myself as just a passive watcher of my own life going by, and when I almost lost my little brother, it made me feel like if I want a change I need to make it now. So I made business school that change and threw myself fully into it, and the rest is history.

I did get back my spark. When I first joined Google, everything was new, everything was exciting. On the two hour bus ride back from Sunnyvale I'd just read all the technical documentation, how all the Google systems worked, the Google way of doing this or that. The writing was so rich. By the time year four rolled around, I had kind of got the hang of it. I knew how to plan a project and how to execute on it. It felt like the challenge wasn't so much learning anymore, but fulfilling all of the process required to change a super reliable system like Google Cloud. I had fallen into a rhythm. At school, all of a sudden I was surrounded by these young kids who, in my opinion, didn't know the first thing about business, but had all this energy and passion. 








# Why business school wasn't for me

I graduated from Yale School of Mangement in May and I really just felt relief that it was over. This "best two years of your life" according to any business school grad, this magical time, magical community, it really wasn't for me. I'm glad that I went back to school and I feel that I grew as a person because of it. But I could not stand the culture.

By the second year, I had effectively dropped out of the business school part of business school. I only took three classes there the entire second year. I did this because I felt that, for the most part, the teachers that I really respected by and large didn't teach the electives available to 2nd years, and this responsibility fell to teachers who I regarded as less exciting. So, instead of taking blah classes, I went out to other parts of Yale and took classes that I really thought were interesting: Critical Race Theory taught by a former Deputy Attorney General of the US. Family Law taught by the pre-eminent feminist faculty at the Law School, a Dance class taught by a former member of a professional ballet group. *These* were really the experiences that I learned from, and that excited me.

Perhaps taking classes at other schools did not help with this unshakable feeling that I got during my first year: that at this place, I did not fit in. I knew we at the Yale School of Management all care about having a good career, but I underestimated just how careerist this crowd was. The lengths that people would go to to show these employers how much they wanted to be employed by them. On my learning team of four, who did homework together all year, we had one guy up and take off, flying around the country all first year, not going to class, not doing the homework. We were able to get along without him, but my gosh, what a let down, and from my opinion, what a waste of school. Why are you paying for school when you're not interested in doing any school? I had hoped to connect with folks through learning, but I had a hard time there finding my group. I did find many people, however, who viewed school as another hoop to jump through on their way to the top of the career ladder. I just thought it was sad.

Rather than trying to fit in, I just accepted that this wasn't my jam and took it as an invitation to explore. I did several bikepacking trips over school break: one across Florida, one across the United States, and after graduation, one across Europe. The conventional wisdom was that as a software engineer at Google, going back to business school didn't make sense. Why would I leave a prestigious and stable career on my own volition, to go somewhere where I am losing money? Said seemingly everyone on reddit everytime a FAANG engineer. And maybe they're right. 




































# Why I left Google for an MBA (and how it went)

Coming up on three years ago, I made the decision to leave Google to go to business school. Going back into the workforce, I find I am asked why I made this decision, which has forced me to do more reflection on it than I previously had. I decided to write this to understand my own story and publish it for anyone who is interested.

Covid was very isolating for me. I really struggled. I struggled to find connection. I felt that I was just "trying to get through it". And then even after Covid, I'd go into the office when it opened up, but I was usually there alone. In my personal life, when quarantine ended, I found that many of my pre-Covid friend group had moved on, to a different city, or to a different stage of life. Then, I almost lost my little brother and that was a signal to me that life is fleeting, and what I'm doing right now, it's not working and I need a change.

Both my parents went to business school, and they loved it. (OK, well my dad loved it, my mom was more so-so on it). Part of me thought that, well, if I'm looking for connection, maybe that's one place I could find it. There are people there my age, who are ambitious like me, who like learning, who value education. And who knows, maybe there are other career paths out there that are a better fit for me. At the very least, going back to school would give me a strong foundation on which to build my career, and inform which direction that I want to take my life.

In March 2023, I quit. I had six months before school started, and every day for these six months I wrote and performed stand-up comedy. I had been going to open mics for several months, and now I dedicated myself to it. I'd write in the mornings and perform what I wrote at night. I realized I could make way more progress in NYC, hit 3 or 4 mics in a night, so I'd take the train down for the weekend and stay with my sister or my cousin. 

The stand-up comedy scene is both electric and very, very sad. It's brutally painful, to work so hard on a joke only to bomb in front of a bunch of strangers. I found that stand-up comics are people who just want to be heard. And some of them are funny, but not all of them, the thing that stand-up comics really have in common is that they want to *appear* funny. And to put together a show that achieves that goal. While it was brutally painful at times, I felt that I was developing as a person. I became more comfortable speaking in front of crowds, more comfortable with failure, I learned about what a joke is, why it's important, and how to write them. I also learned about myself, as I found the jokes that got the laughs were the ones that were authentic to me, and true. I did feel that I was doing the exploring that I wanted to do when I was staring out the window of the Google office in Embarcadero. I felt that I was taking a risk, and living my life.

It was quite a transition to go from dingy bars to the glass tower that is the Yale School of Management. I want to say it was two weeks in that I realized that I was not a good fit for this school. I learned that the other students were not just paying lip service to their career ambitions after school, I felt that by and large they were completely and hopelessly obsessed with achieving a particular career outcome. Future bankers would study 10 hours a day on Saturdays to memorize financial formulas. Consultants would "coffee chat" with future employers instead of going to class. One guy on my learning team spent the entire year traveling around the country going to interviews, we never saw him, did his work for him, and our team of four effectively became three. I really went back to school because I wanted connect through learning, and I felt completely alone in this endeavor. 

I could not stand the school social scene. It was like going back to high school. There was a rumor mill, always a rumor mill. People stressed over the grades they got in class, as if it mattered. They idolized all of the teachers, even the ones who were full of crap. I felt that many of them hadn't really worked before, and didn't know what working was like. They didn't know about building things, and that nobody cares about "participation credit" or Powerpoint deck style, but rather whether the work got done or not. They blamed the CDO for being unhelpful, which in my experience, they were completely unhelpful, but like it was the CDO's responsibility to get them a job. In short, I felt that they were entitled and insecure, and many of them were going to struggle in the real world, despite their elite credentials.

--The startup experience?--

By the end of first year I was so sick of the school culture that I just wanted to get on my bike and bike as far away from it as I could. So I did. I saddled up my gravel bike with bikepacking bags and biked across the U.S., from Portland, Maine to Pacific City, Oregon. This trip was amazing. It was terrifying. It was communal. It was lonely. It was all the things that I wanted to do, to experience. To just go out and see the world, beyond the big glass windows of whatever corporatey office building I was in. I felt that I was living my dream. And sometimes even now I think back to snapshots of the trip, the sun setting over Lake Superior, the dry Badlands, the endless fields of wheat in Eastern Washington, and I can't believe I really did that, I saw all those things. And that those memories will be with me for the rest of my life.

In the ensuing fall, I returned to school but I took zero classes at the business school. I took law and writing classes. I took a dance class at the school of art. I took the classes that were totally out of my comfort zone where I thought that I would fail. I tried new forms of writing, wrote poems, fiction, read different kinds of literature, took Critical Race Theory which exposed me to a way of thinking about the world that I just didn't as a White person. I remember seeing these comedians tell these jokes about race, but I was scared of touching the subject because I didn't know anything about it. That changed. 

Over Winter Break 2nd year the business school classmates did these fabulous trips to international meccas and I went an biked the Florida Divide Trail from Tallahassee to Del Ray, camping out half the time, in sandy and rural Central Florida. It was brutal, the offroad trails were slow and unmaintained, the few roads were not really made for biking, I spent pretty much the entire two weeks alone, but it was also awesome. In the Spring the highlight was Family Law, a class where we read 250 cases, most of them families getting ripped apart in public. It was sad. But that one really made me appreciate the family that I've got, that I've got two loving parents who support me and want the best for me. Everyone should have that, but not everyone does it turns out.

Then I did a 3rd bike trip through Europe from Malaga to Oslo. As I'm writing this I'm realizing that solo bikepacking became a core part of my business school experience. The truth is, I didn't really want to go to business school. I just wanted an excuse to go see the world. I was afraid, maybe, to quit my job at Google without having some sort of plan, some structure to my next two years. And maybe rightfully so. I'm someone who needs structure. And business school ended up giving me a lot, even if I hated business school. I felt that I grew as a person. Better understood myself. Developed new skills. Was around ambitious people who provided me a spark. Took classes that challenged me and grew through that. So this was the phase of life to go explore the world. Maybe other people do it earlier. Maybe some do it at the same time, but not for three years. Maybe others don't do it. But I did. And I feel that I'm better for it.

Coming out of business school, finding a job has been much harder than I thought it would be. I went back to the old SWE roles I used to do but largely got rejected from all of them. Maybe it's the job market. Maybe it's that from an engineering perspecitve, I have a three year gap on my resume. But after three months I found a job back at Capital One as a Senior SWE. Having gone to business school, it is kind of a bummer that I'll be going back into the workforce in a job that might be considered less presitigious, pays less than the one that I had before I went to school. But business school was never about getting the best job. It was about exploring the world. And I did that, and I'm proud that I did that.







1. I was frustrated by the process at Google

The pro of working on Google Cloud is that I get to see what it's like to work on a high-reliability system. The con is in practice this reliability requires a ton of process, something I don't like and never really have. I like to just get stuff done. The last project I did at Google lasted over a year, required seemingly more docs than lines of code, and at the end of the day, was hugely impactful. I felt that I had done what I came to Google to do, to be a Google-level engineer, I had achieved that, and now that I had understood what was going on, it felt like the pace of play slowed way down. I felt like I could hang on to this gravy train for a little longer, but it would come at the cost of my own development and I would surely feel the pain of my laxity somewhere down the road. I needed a change.


Some of my friends at Google left to either join early-stage companies or start their own companies. Maybe this is a more conventional path for an engineer at Google who is frustrated by the routine. And the startup life looked exciting. In the time it took me to refactor test infrastructure, my friend went from zero to raising a seed round. I saw the financing press releases, the new websites, the blogs about new features and customer integrations. From where I was sitting, it looked like all of these startups were going up and to the right. 

But growing up I saw my dad work with early-stage companies for his career, and I saw from him that startups are not all fun and games, they do not always go up and to the right, and they can actually be quite painful. For this reason I did not want to just dive into the ocean. At Google I learned how to swim. I felt like it would be more helpful for me to zoom out, to understand the waves and currents of the business world from experts in order to identify where are the waves that I want to surf.
